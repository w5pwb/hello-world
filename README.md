A place to store ideas and junk.


When I was in graduate school (PhD biology, 2006) I took a couple of computer science classes because I needed to fulfill an antiquated skills requirement for my degree.  I enjoyed them quite a bit but when I was done I went back to the lab and focused soely on my thesis work, none of which involved any degree of coding at all.  This was an unfortunate mistake.

At around the time I was taking a class in Java, I came across an add in a science magazine (can't remember which one) for emplyment with Google.  The add had a numerical puzzle to solve in the form of a vending machine with items that could be ordered by multiplying two numbers on the keypad.  One item was unavailable because no combination for it existed.  I took ti as a fun challenge to write a short program to find the combination.  It took me few hours and, at about 2 in the morning, I finished my code, compiled, and solved the puzzle.  I loved it.  That evening was one of the few moments in my life where I was turely in "the zone" and had no concept of time invested in the project.  

And then I went back to the lab and the program, and job ad, were lost to time.  

Looking back this should have been a sign that, at the least, I should have supplememnted my PhD with an MS in computer science.  I'd have done well and probably have had a much more enriching career to date.  

Presently I'm looking at a tough funding situation, a job that isn't fulfilling at all, and a second act in life that needs to be much more meaningful careerwise than the first.  I'm brushing up on my coding skills, learning new languages, and poking around various organizations for opportunities to use my technical skills and interest in coding to move into a developer position.  My PhD taught me a lot of very useful skills which, if I'd combined them with CS, would have taken me to some amazing places.  I think I can still get there.
